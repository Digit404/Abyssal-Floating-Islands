# Floating-Islands-1.19
Datapack that changes overworld and nether world generation to be floating islands.

Unlike default 1.19, which leaves the nether the same and has no biomes (and therefore no unique structures like villages). This datapack creates floating island worlds in the nether and overworld, with all structures and biomes so everything possibly in vanilla is possible here. :D

If it is requested, I will make a version without the nether changed or vice versa, but all you would need to do is delete the overworld.json or nether.json file in the datapack.

Additionally I could attempt to do a caves world gen (like for the end or overworld), but I myself don't have that much of an interest in it at the moment. Let me know if you are interested. :).

OH! And if people think the oceans are a bit overkill, I could try to reduce them.


Backstory: A week or two ago, I wanted to play a floating islands on survival. I watched a video on how to do it, but things kept going wrong. Firstly, the video was for 1.18, and 1.19 does not allow you to import world gen settings due to a bug that is currently unpatched. Secondly, because floating islands have become unsupported by mojang (kind of) they only generate river and frozen river biomes in the overworld. This made me very upset because I wanted the full experience: jungles, badlands, snowy taigas, villages, outposts, mansions, etc. Only river biomes stopped this from occuring. I tried seeking help, but could not find any. Eventually, I came back to it today and I made huge progress and in only a few hours, I found out how to add the biomes back and tweaked the world gen to go lower than normal (so you could get proper deepslate layers). I also lowered the height of the floating islands a tiny bit (from y=184 to y=160) because the world felt a bit larger with the added lower y-values (which caused more lag, this is kind of a laggy datapack though but should not be terrible). 

After dealing with the overworld, I took a crack at the nether and it was also easier than I expected so I just did that as well.
